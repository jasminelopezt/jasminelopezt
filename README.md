### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


:woman_technologist:	Here's a little about me in less than 60 seconds! My name is Jasmine Lopez but those that get to know me call me Jas ðŸ˜„ . After working in the animal health field for a few years, I decided to pivot into the Data Analytics field. One of the main reasons is because during the beginning of the pandemic, I started working remotely as a Data Specialist. This role ignited my love for solving questions by looking at data. 

I'm currently sharpening my skills in SQL, Python, Tableau :chart_with_downwards_trend:	, and Excel to understand what it is to truly be a knowledgeable Data Analyst!

I'm looking to meet fellow Data lovers! How are you making a difference in the world with what you know?! I'd love to learn how!

:boom:
FUN FACT ABOUT ME: I sew on my free time and I'm currently in the process of making my own wardrobe. 

Thank you for visiting my page, and hope you follow me on my journey. :smiley:
